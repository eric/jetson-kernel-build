# Jetson Nano kernel builder

This is a Docker container that can be used to build a custom Jetson Nano
Linux Kernel.

The `Dockerfile` included will build the kernel with config settings and
a patch required to make iPhone USB Tethering work.

*Note:* This is a work in progress and requires understanding of what's
going on to do anything with it right now.
